# Sink of Scrubbing

Enhances immersion & roleplaying by making wash basins useable, giving you the choice of either grooming yourself or refreshing yourself & provides small buffs to Resist Disease & Speechcraft after cleaning for 4 hours.

## Features

- Makes Wash Basins useable by letting you Groom (open the racemenu) or "Refresh yourself".
- Refreshing yourself will grant you a 25% bonus to Resist Disease & give you a +5 to Speechcraft.
- Built-in support for Dirt and Blood. Will not fully clean the character, but set it to the lowest level of dirtiness. Similar to how swimming in water works in D&B. **Dirt & Blood effects will override Sink of Scrubbins clean effect**

## Requirements

- SKSE64
- Base Object Swapper

## Installation

- Navigate to Files
- Click "Mod Manager Download"
- ???
- Profit

## Compatibility

- Built-in compatibility for Dirt and Blood - Dynamic Visuals.
- Not built to work with other cleaning mods as of now. But will work standalone with it's own effect.
- Should be compatible with anything that places the vanilla Wash Basin as BoS will swap the object.
- Obviously not compatible with Interactive Wash Basins or Interactive Wash Basins - Base Object Swapper.

## Recommended mods

- [Water in Wash Basins](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59333)
	- This will add water to the basins, which looks a lot better than the vanilla empty basins.
- [Dirt and Blood - Dynamic Visuals](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38886)
	- Adds a dirtiness system to the player.
