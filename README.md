# Sink of Scrubbing

A simple mod for Skyrim Special Edition that makes the Wash basins in the game usable. Gives the player a choice of either grooming themselves or refreshing themselves. 

Provides small buffs when cleaning to give a small incentive to doing so. Mostly made for immersion/roleplay purposes. Also provides a nice little message after refreshing yourself.

Does not come with any animations or anything like that to avoid placing markers, as well as to keep it simple and straight-forward. Mod is open source so feel free to expand upon it if you wish, permissions are all open.

## Features

- Makes Wash Basins interactable
- Provides small buff to Resist Disease & Speechcraft after cleaning for 4 hours
- Built-in support for Dirt and Blood, but works standalone as well.
- Mod is provided as-is, open source, and permissions are open. Might add more to it in the future tho, but for now it's just a simple mod.
