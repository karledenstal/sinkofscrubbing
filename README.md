# Sink of Scrubbing

A simple mod for Skyrim Special Edition that makes the Wash basins in the game usable. Gives the player a choice of either grooming themselves or refreshing themselves. 

Provides small buffs when cleaning to give a small incentive to doing so. Mostly made for immersion/roleplay purposes. Also provides a nice little message after refreshing/grooming.

Does not come with any animations or anything like that to avoid placing markers, as well as to keep it simple and straight-forward. Mod is open source so feel free to expand upon it if you wish, permissions are all open.
