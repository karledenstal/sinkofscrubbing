# Sink of Scrubbing

A simple mod for Skyrim Special Edition that makes the Wash basins in the game usable. Gives the player a choice of either grooming themselves or refreshing themselves. 

Provides small buffs when cleaning to give a small incentive to doing so. Mostly made for immersion/roleplay purposes. Also provides a nice little message after refreshing yourself.

## Features

- Makes Wash Basins interactable
- Provides small buff to Resist Disease & Speechcraft after cleaning for 4 hours
- Built-in support for Dirt and Blood, but works standalone as well.
- Mod is provided as-is, open source, and permissions are open. Might add more to it in the future tho, but for now it's just a simple mod.

## Requirements

- SKSE64
- Base Object Swapper

## Installation

Install with preferred mod manager.

## Compatibility

- Built-in compatibility for Dirt and Blood - Dynamic Visuals. Will not fully clean the character, but set it to the lowest level of dirtiness. Similar to how swimming in water works in D&B.
- Not built to work with other cleaning mods as of now. But will work standalone with it's own effect.
- Should be compatible with most things.
- Obviously not compatible with Interactive Wash Basins or Interactive Wash Basins - Base Object Swapper.
