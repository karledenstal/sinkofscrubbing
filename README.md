# Sink of Scrubbing

A simple mod for Skyrim Special Edition that makes the Wash basins in the game usable. Gives the player a choice of either grooming themselves or refreshing themselves. 

Provides small buffs when cleaning to give a small incentive to doing so. Mostly made for immersion/roleplay purposes. Also provides a nice little message after refreshing/grooming.
